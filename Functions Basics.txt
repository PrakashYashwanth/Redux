-> In JS, we treat the functions as any other variable.
    -> Like
        -> assign them in variable
        -> pass them as arguments
        -> return them from another functional
        -> Hence JS functions are called first-class objects or first-class citizens

-> Higher-Order Function
    -> A higher-order function is a function which takes function as a parameter or which returns the function or both

-> Currying in JS
    -> Currying is a technique that allows us to take multiple arguments of function and
         convert it into a function that has single argument

-> Pure Functions
    -> Pure function is a function which always give same output if we give it the same input.
    -> No current date/time
    -> No random values
    -> No global state
    -> No database calls

    -> Benifits
        -> Easy to test
        -> Easy to reuse
        -> Self explanatory

-> Immutability
    -> Once we create variable or string or object or array, it cannot be changed.
    -> If you want to change that, we have to make copy first of that data and then update that copy.
    -> Increase the predictability
    -> Faster change detection

        -> immutability in Objects
            -> Object.assign method
            -> Using spread operator

        -> immutability in Arrays
            -> Adding an item
            -> Removing an item
            -> Updating an item
