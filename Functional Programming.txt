-> 4 types -> Procedural, Logical, Functional, Object-oriented programmings

-> Functional programming -> having small functions clubbed to form more complex functions

-> Benifits

    -> More readable
    -> More reusable
    -> Easier to debug

-> Languages specific to functional programming -> Haskell, Erlang
